                <p>In less than 40 years under the visionary leadership of Vice President and Prime Minister of the
                    United Arab Emirates
                    and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai has transformed itself
                    from a local trading
                    community into a global financial center and global trading house. Its progress continues to make
                    global headlines and
                    it is now a strong commercial destination for Investors and Operating Business Entities seeking to
                    capitalize on Dubai’s
                    strategic positioning as a leading destination for tourism as well as businesses alike. With a
                    diversity unique in the
                    region, multicultural population, Dubai offers its residents and businesses a unique environment,
                    enriched with a
                    polyglot of talent and a quality of life and work unrivalled in the Middle East. It is a bustling
                    metropolis with a
                    combination of Emirati heritage, Arabic vitality, Western spontaneity and Asian ambition. As
                    thousands of new businesses
                    are discovering each year, Dubai is an effective jurisdiction and structured environment, with an
                    ease of doing business
                    which rivals and often exceeds other financial gateways, the perfect positioning between East and
                    West and the preferred
                    hub for the region’s imports and exports market – one of the most lucrative in the world. Dubai’s
                    strategic location
                    gives easy access to 2.2 billion consumers, from a unique centralized positioning & time zone that
                    combines East and
                    West business hours.</p>

                <p>All onshore businesses targeting the local markets of Dubai, Abu Dhabi or the UAE are generally
                    incorporated within
                    mainland of their respective city. For businesses based in mainland Dubai, non-UAE nationals,
                    including nationals of
                    other GCC states, can register their businesses in the respective city’s Department of Economic
                    Development.</p>

                <p>Businesses planning to operate offshore choose a free zone based on the sector they operate in and
                    their type of
                    activities. Each free zone is governed by an independent Free Zone Authority (FZA), which is
                    responsible for issuing the
                    necessary licenses. Various free zones have different minimum capital requirements. In general,
                    three options exist for
                    investors wishing to set up their businesses within a free zone. A business wishing to operate from
                    a free zone can
                    either incorporate a free zone establishment (FZE), a free zone company (FZC) or operate through a
                    branch office of a
                    foreign or local company. Branch offices are subject to a limited amount of administration
                    requirements.
